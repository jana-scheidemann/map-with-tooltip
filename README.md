# World map 🗺️

I wanted to play around with a 🌎 map 🌏 for a while and finally figured out how to use the react-simple-map with tooltip. Made me very happy 😎

Their [current example](https://www.react-simple-maps.io/examples/map-chart-with-tooltip/) isn't working properly, but the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/z6PzPTxfgZM?si=gXN7CPuLL5x2WENk) of "Code with Irtiza" in comination with the docs of [React Tooltip](https://react-tooltip.com) of helped a lot.
