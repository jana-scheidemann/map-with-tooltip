# World map 🗺️

I wanted to play around with a 🌎 map 🌏 for a while and finally figured out how to use the react-simple-map with tooltip. Made me very happy 😎

The [current example](https://www.react-simple-maps.io/examples/map-chart-with-tooltip/) of a map with tooltip from react-simple-maps isn't working properly, but the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/z6PzPTxfgZM?si=gXN7CPuLL5x2WENk) of "Code with Irtiza" in comination with the docs of [React Tooltip](https://react-tooltip.com) helped a lot.

## Next

I want to convert this map into a digital version of a scratch map (a map where a filled background of a country symbolizes this has been visited). So far I couldn't find a better geoJSON and also struggle to implement the useState for the "isVisited" state. I am on it 💪🏻

## Tech Stack

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
